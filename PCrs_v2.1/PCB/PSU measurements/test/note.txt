Switching voltage regulator test measurements were made with 20MHz bandwidth limit, 100Ohm resistive load & electrolytics capacitors

For example:
OUT 33uCap - stands for additional 33uF electrolytic capacitor on output of the buck converter
IN 100uCap - stands for additional 100uF electrolytic capacitor on input of the buck converter
