Switching voltage regulator in-system measurements were made with 20MHz bandwidth limit, 100Ohm resistive load & following capacitors: 220uF input electrolytic cap, 220uF output electrolytic cap & 88uF output ceramic caps

Note that electrolytic capacitors are THD (Trough Hole Devices) & have higher inductance on their terminals which affects the voltage ripple (current resonance effect)

See the pictures in this folder for test configuration.
